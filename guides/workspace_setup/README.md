# Workspace Setup

*Time Estimate: 10-15 minutes*

This guide will take us through the setup process of our workspace!

The workspace consists of two tools: [GitHub](#) and [Cloud 9](#). These crucial tools are required to take advantage of the rest of Cipher's guides.

Note: When you see: **[GIF]**, this means the image below is a GIF -- a looping video!

## Table of Contents

1. [GitHub](#github)
2. [Cloud 9](#cloud-9)

## Part I: Creating Accounts

Let's create a [GitHub](#) and [Cloud 9](#) account!

### 1) Signing Up for a GitHub Account

Good news! This is a super easy process that wouldn't take too long.

#### 1. Navigate to https://github.com

  ![Github page](img/github.png)

#### 2. Sign up through the form

  ![Github form](img/github_form.png)

#### 3. Navigate to account settings

  ![Github settings](img/github_settings.png)

#### 4. Add your name and a picture, then click "Update profile"

  ![Github profile](img/github_profile.png)

#### 5. Check the inbox of the email you registered with and verify your email address

### 2) Signing Up for a Cloud 9 Account

This process is even faster than GitHub's because C9 allows you to sign in with your GitHub account!

#### 1. Navigate to http://c9.io

  ![C9 page](img/c9.png)

#### 2. Log in using your GitHub account

Click the GitHub button at the top-right of the page. It looks like this: ![GitHub icon](img/c9_gh_icon.png).

Then enter your GitHub email address and password to sign in!

#### 3. If C9 asks you for payment info
Use these credientials:

| Cardholder Name | Card Number | Expiry Date | CVV |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Project Cipher | 5113 4026 7731 5930 | 08/20 | 555 |

It's a empty prepaid credit card, so dont try nothin fancy.

#### 4. You should be taken to a screen that looks like this:

![C9 landing page](img/c9_landing_page.png)

**Keep this tab open!**

> If you receive some sort of error, ask the person next to you for some help! If that doesn't help, ask the facilitator for help.

### 5) Celebrate!

We made it! We just have a few more steps to finish our set-up.

## Part II: Creating a C9 Workspace

### 1) Create a GitHub Repository

We've already created a [GitHub](#) account, so let's put it to use!

1. Go to https://github.com -- make sure you're signed in

![GitHub site landing](img/1.1_github_site.png)

2. Click the green **"+ New repository"** button on the right side of the page

![New repo button](img/2_new_repo.png)

3. Under "Repository name" write your USERNAME.github.io

Note: instead of writing USERNAME, write your GitHub username. This is stated under "Owner".

![Naming repo](img/2.2_naming_repo.png)

- For example, my username is jevinsidhu, so I would write jevinsidhu.github.io.

4. Click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom.

5. You will be taken to a new page. There, copy the "HTTPS link" at the top. You will need this for the next step!

Note: it should look like this: `https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git`.

![https link](img/4_https_link.png)

### 2) Create a C9 Workspace

We've also already created a [C9](#) account, so let's put that to use.

Head back to the tab you left open -- if you closed it, just go to https://c9.io.

We will need to create a "workspace" to have a place to write our code!

1. Click "Create a new workspace"

![C9 creation](img/c9_workspace_creation.png)

2. Fill in "Workspace name" with the name "cipher-projects"

![C9 creation 2](img/c9_workspace_creation_2.png)

3. Under "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL", paste the HTTPS link that you copied from the GitHub page.

![C9 adding https URL](img/c9_https_url.png)

4. Without changing anything else, scroll to the bottom and click the green "Create Workspace" button

![C9 creation 3](img/c9_workspace_creation_3.png)

5. You should be welcome by a screen similar to this!

![C9 creation 3](img/c9_landing_workspace.png)

> If are having some trouble, ask the person closest to you for help! If they cannot offer some help, ask your facilitators.

### 3) Celebrate!
