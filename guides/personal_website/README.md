# Personal Website

*Time Estimate: 1 hour*

Note: If you have not set up your workspace, please visit the [Workspace Setup](../workspace_setup/README.md) guide.

## Our Goal

By the end of this guide, you will have created a personal website! Though, it doesn't have to be for you. For example, this is [John Cena’s](http://nguyenbrian.github.io/john-cenas-personal-website/) _(Turn your sound down!)_.

Your final product will look similar to this, but we want you to apply as many changes you as wish:

## What You Will Learn

The basics of two programming languages: [HTML](../DOCUMENTATION.md#HTML) and [CSS](../DOCUMENTATION.md#CSS).

## Part One: Importance of Googling

What happens when don't know how to do something? __Google it!__

Professional programmers Google while on the job. The largest Q&A website for programming (https://stackoverflow.com) __has hundreds of questions submitted by programmers everyday__ who work at giant tech companies like Apple, Facebook and Google.

When searching: Be __specific, clear and concise__.

Try the first 3 links that appear → Then seek help from friends/co-workers

![](img/googling.gif)

In the case above, Google even gives us the answer for our question, _"What does HTML stand for"_, without having to click anything-- neat! 

__Try the same for CSS!__

## Part Two: Log onto Cloud 9

_Note: You should have a Cloud 9 account after following the [Workspace Setup](https://github.com/JevinSidhu/cipher/tree/master/guides/workspace_setup) guide!_

1. Head to https://c9.io

2. Open the workspace titled `"cipher-projects"`.

3. It will take a few seconds to load. After it does, you should get a page that looks similiar to this: 

![C9 landing workspace](img/c9_landing_workspace.png)

## Part Three: Creating Your HTML File

1. __Right click the left section__ where the folder icon is. This area is the directory!

2. Click __“New File”__ and name this file `index.html` 

    Word files end in .doc → HTML files end in .html. This ending tells the computer that the document is written in HTML

    _index.html_ is the usual name for the main HTML file. In larger projects you may have several files -- for this project we will only have one.

3. __Double click the file, `index.html`__, to open it

![Creating the HTML file](img/creating_html.gif)

## Part Four: Opening the Preview

1. On the bar on the top, right below my bookmark tab or URL area, __click  the 2nd last tab, `Preview`.__
 
    You want to be able to see the changes you make. With Word, as you type you can see your changes instantly
    
    With HTML, you need to:
    - Type
    - Save the document
    - View changes on the web

2. Click `Live Preview File`

3. A window on the right side, called the `pane`, will pop up

4. Click the `boxed arrow icon` on the right of the pane to open the web page full screen

![Previewing the HTML file](img/previewing_html.gif)

## Part Five: Writing Some Code!

1. Back to the `index.html` file! Let’s write your name and a description!
 
    **For example:**
    ```
    Jevin Sidhu. 
    My name is Jevin
    ```

2. Save the file by clicking `File` on the top-bar and then `Save` **OR** using the shortcut `CTRL + S/Command + S`

3. Switch to the tab with your `Live Preview` to see your changes!

    You may need to refresh your page because C9 sometimes doesn't auto-refresh in time.
    
_Note: Notice how adding blank lines between your sentences in HTML does not change what it looks like. We need to style elements by using `HTML Tags`._

![](img/writing_html.gif)

## Part Six: Introducing HTML Tags!

`HTML tags` organize information on a web page.

1. Make your name a `header` by putting it between an __opening and closing heading tag__.

    `<h1> [Your Name] </h1>` 
    
    - `<h1>` is the __opening__ `h1 tag`
    - `</h1>` is the __closing__ `h1 tag` → The difference is the _forward slash_ before the name `( / )`
    
  Putting your name between the `h1` tags styles your name with a bigger, bolder font and puts it on a separate line.
      
  _Almost_ all HTML tags have both an opening and closing tag → The ones that don’t we will discuss.
    
   ![](img/introducing_tags_html.gif)

## Part Seven: More about Headings

There are six different headers: `<h1>` through `<h6>`
 
`<h1>` tag indicates that the text between the opening and closing tags is the __most important__. `<h6>`is the __least important__. 
Therefore, the closer the tag is to h1 numerically, the larger the text!

Try it out!

## Part Eight: Adding an Image

1. To add an image, use the image tag: 

    `<img src=“http://website.com/file-name.png ”>`
    
   __`img`__ is the `tag name` → This is self-closing, meaning there is no closing tag, like `</img>`
   
    __`src`__ is an `attribute` that specifies the URL of the image
     - Add the URL of our image between the quotes
    - Upload an image to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) or get one from [Google Images](https://images.google.com).
        - To get the URL, right click the image and hit **copy image address**
 
  ![](img/getimage.png)
  
    ![](img/img_tag.gif)

_Note: The web page reads HTML top to bottom. If you put the tag above the text, it will show up above the text. If you put the tag below the text, it will show up below._

   ![](img/top_to_bottom.gif)

## Part Nine: Introducing CSS

`HTML` is for content 
  - Like the skeleton (sp00ky) of a body
`CSS` is to change the way things look and feel
  - Like the colour, width, height of your face/skin

Therefore, if we want to change the size of the image → Use `CSS`!

__Create a CSS file by:__

1. Right clicking the area to the directory (left-most section)

2. Click `New File`

3. Name it by typing: `main.css`
    The extension acts as an identifier for the computer (just like `.doc` or `.html`). `main.css` is the common name for the main CSS file.

4. Double click to open the file

    ![](img/introducing_css.gif)

## Part Ten: Adding the Head Tag 

1. Let’s hop back to our index.html file by double clicking it

    We need to __tell the web page some information__ about our HTML file! None of this information should show up on the webpage itself. I.e. Show up like your name on the page
    
    To do this: we need to enclose the information in a `<head>` tag
      - Remember to close the tag with closing `</head>` tag → This is __not like the `img` tag__
      - C9 closes tags automatically for you, but you may delete it by accident sometimes

2. Write the tag `<head>` and make sure you have the closing tag `</head>`

    ![](img/adding_head.gif)
    
    Computers are dumb; they are powerful because humans program them.
    
    We have these two files, the HTML file and the CSS file. The computer draws __no__ association between the two:
    - We need to specifically tell them → Link these two together so they are connected

## Part Eleven: Linking the CSS file to the HTML

1. Let’s link the HTML and CSS file! You have to add another tag for this.

    The code is: `<link rel= “stylesheet” href=“FILENAME” >` 
    
    - `link` is a tag → it’s self-closing, like the `img` tag, so there is no closing tag ( `</link>` )
      - This lets the webpage know you are linking something
    
    - `href` is an `attribute`, like the `src` one for the `img` tag, that specifies the location of a file
    
    - `rel` is also an `attribute` that tells the HTML what sort of file it is linking to

2. Add the name of the `CSS` file between the quotes → `<link rel= “stylesheet” href=“main.css”>` 

    Ensure you include the extension: `.css` → `main.css` NOT just `main`

    ![](img/linking_css.gif)

## Part Twelve: Change the Image Size

1. Let’s hop onto the CSS file → Double click the `main.css` file on the right directory

    ![](img/changing_image_size.gif)

2. Before we got side-tracked, we were trying to change the size of our image -- it’s way too big right now 

    Let’s write some code to change that in the `main.css` file:
    
    ````
    img {
      width: 25%;
    }
    ````
    
    Play around with the value → The lower it is, the smaller the image will become!
    
    ![](img/changing_image_size2.gif)

## Part Thirteen: The Breakdown

Let’s break this down into an English sentence:

![](img/breakdown1.png)

This is called __pseudo-code__ → Code that wouldn’t run on the computer, but we’re making sense of it

![](img/breakdown2.png)

For every `<img>` tag on the web page

![](img/breakdown3.png)

I want all the style properties inside the curly brackets `({ })` to apply:

![](img/breakdown4.png)

 specifically, I want the `width

![](img/breakdown5.png)

to be `50%` of the `width` of the page.
 
## Part Fourteen: Vocabulary

![](img/breakdown6.png)

`img` is called the **selector**, it "selects" all of the img tags and applies all of the settings inside of the curly braces `({ })`

![](img/breakdown7.png)

`{ }` are called __curly braces__

![](img/breakdown8.png)

The name on the __left side of the colon__ is called the **property**, in this case it is `width`.

![](img/breakdown9.png)

`50%` is what's known as the **value** → End the property + value declaration with semicolon `(;)`. This acts like a period.

## Part Fifteen: Pixels versus Percentage

If you resize the page, the image will adjust to be `25%` of the total view.
 
If we want the image to stay a constant size → We need to use a different **value type** named `pixels`

![](img/percentage_scaling.gif)

1. Set the `width` (property) to `200px` (value) instead of `25%` (value)

    Use `pixels: [number]px` instead of `[number]%` → A pixel is a single point in an image and thousands make up one
    - This specifies how big the image should be no matter the size of the page
    - Remember to end the value `(200px)` with a semicolon `(;)` and close the curly braces `( } )`

![](img/pixel_scaling.gif)

## Part 6teen: Making the Image a Circle

Let’s __Google__ how to make our image a circle! → Remember: Be __specific, clear and concise:__
  - I Googled: "make image circular in CSS"

This was the first one I found, but if yours wasn’t this one -- don’t stress, it’s most likely still fine!        

![](img/rounded_images.png)

![](img/rounded_images2.png)

1. Add: `border-radius: 50%;` → have a __line-break between each property and value with the “enter” key__

    ![](img/rounded_images3.png)

## Part Seventeen: The Body Tag

The tag that usually encloses the main document is: `<body> </body>`

The `<body>` tag contains all the contents of an `HTML` document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc → Does not include the `<head>` tag.

1. Create a body section by putting the opening `<body>` tag before your website's visible content begins, and a closing `</body` tag after your website's content ends.

2. Let’s make the code more readable
    - Indent everything enclosed in the `<body>` tag:
      - Highlight by left-clicking and then drag across the text __inside__ of the tag (do not highlight `<body>`).
    - Click the __“tab”__ key on your keyboard
    - Ensure you indent future lines of code inside of the `<body>` tag
    
    ![](img/adding_body.gif)

4. Now try indenting the code inside the `<head>` tag!

## Part Eighteen: Centre your Image + Text

1. Let’s center our picture and name inside the `<body>` tag

    Open the `main.css` file and using the previously learned `CSS selector`, select the `<body>` tag

2. CSS property: `text-align` to control whether our objects are `left`, `center`, or `right-aligned`

    Images are considered “text" in this sense and so the property affects images as well.

3. CSS value: `center` -- to center the text → There is also __left__ and __right__ to align each way

    Code:
    ```
    body { 
     text-align: center; 
    } 
    ```
    
    ![](img/aligning_text.gif)

## Part Nineteen: Change your Background Colour

1. Let’s change that white to another colour!

2. Within the __CSS body selector__ let’s declare another CSS property named `background-color`

    This does exactly what is sounds like: allows us to change the background color.

3. The CSS value for this property will be a colour

    Colours can be the name of the colour. I.e. grey, white, black, hot pink.

    Colours also have codes, known as hex codes → You need # before the number. I.e. #808080 = Grey + #000 = Black + #ffff = White.

    Black and white have only 3 digits, but most hex codes are 6 digits long.

    Code: `background-color: #HEXCODE;`

    ![](img/background_color.gif)

    Check out some beautiful colours here: http://colorhunt.co/

## Part Twenty: Color the `<h1>` Tag

1. Let’s change the __color__ of our __`<h1>` heading__ as well
    
2. Create a __CSS selector__ in our `main.css` file for `<h1>`

    ```
    h1 { 
     
    }
    ```

3. Use the CSS property, `color:` and CSS value (hex-color) `#fff` or `white`; to make it white
    
    This isn’t the `background-color`of the text, it is simply the `color` of the font
    
    It should look something like this:
    
    ```
    h1 { 
        color: #fff; 
    }
    ```

    ![](img/color.gif)

## Part Twenty-One: Intro to Margin & Padding 

Let’s take a second to introduce two new concepts: margin and padding.

__Margin__ clears an area around an element
  - It’s completely transparent
  - __Top, right, bottom, and left margin__ can be changed independently using separate properties.

__Padding__ clears an area around the content of an element inside the border
  - It’s affected by the background color of the element.
  - __Top, right, bottom, and left padding__ can be changed independently using separate properties.

![](img/margin_padding.png)

Example: You have a ring  and you’re putting it in a gift bag. The __area around the ring in the bag is padding__, the __area between the bag and your hand is margin.__ 

1. The picture and text are too close to the top of the webpage -- Let’s fix this.

    We need another __CSS property__ called `margin` and __CSS value__: a `numerical value (percent or pixels)`

2. Let’s use the img tag → Therefore we must use the CSS `img selector`

    We use the `img` tag because that is the closest thing to the top

    If we move that, the text under it will move as well 
    
3. We are using the `margin` but want to use specifically the top as the property → `margin-top: 250px;`

    ![](img/margin_padding.gif)
