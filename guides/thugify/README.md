# Guide Three: Thugify

##Introduction
###What is Thugify?
Thugify is an introduction to the basics of Javascript

We'll be adding ", dawg" to the end of whatever you type into an input box — simple, but sweet.
* You'll be able to change the word added at your own will.
* You can customize this to make it Politify, which adds ",please" instead

This slide deck created by Amy Sorto and modified by [Cipher](http://projectcipher.io) is a great introduction to key concepts. Please take a look through it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2l9FTYlGCocr8cqjLaHpp5tgv0hS-WI3US7PiMbRnc/edit)!

##Workspace Setup
###Create Your Files

1. create a `index.html` file
2. create a `style.css` file
3. create a `script.js` file

## Setting Up Your HTML File

### Connecting the Files
We need to connect the HTML file to the CSS and JavaScript files. 

Let's connect the CSS file first: `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">`

This line creates a `link` tag that describes:
- the location of the CSS file with the attribute `href`
- that we are linking a "stylesheet", or CSS file with the attribute`rel`

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> 
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>

  <body> 
  
    <script src="script.js"> </script>
  </body>

</html>```
```<script src="script.js">``` is **linking the HTML file to the JS file**
* Webpages + browsers are really dumb, humans just make them smart
* ```<script>``` is a tag that links the HTML file to the JavaScript file
 * ```src``` is called an **attribute**
   * It **specifies the location** — in this case it was simply the file name, *“script.js”* 

###NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CLOSING TAGS
```<h1> </h1>```

##Creating the HTML Structure
Our focus for this workship is the basics of **JavaScript + jQuery.** Let's finish up our HTML first!
![](https---d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net-s_E2C9EC3A53C7D3F150F7715638F7F1B7BEFDBDD43B2CBAF8BECDEE9CE6CD10B0_1449367351294_giphy.gif)

Next, let's connect the JavaScript file: `<script src="script.js"> </script>`

```<script>``` is a tag that links the HTML file to the JavaScript file
 * ```src``` is an attribute that specifies the location
   * the location is the file name, `script.js`

### Create the Structure

First, create a `<div> </div>` tag.

This is a container to:
* organize our content
* apply styling from our **style.css** file to everything enclosed

```
<div>

</div>
```

Next, add the name of the workshop, let's create a `<h1> </h1>` header tag.

Give the header tag an id of "title"
* Type `id="title"` before the `<h1` is closed

It should look like this: `<h1 id="title"> Thugify </h1>`

* I.e. there may be multiple `<h1>` tags in your code
* To select one it needs to have its custom name, thus the id

Indent your code!
* Indenting items that are enclosed within another tag is important for your own readability
  * In this case `<h1>` is enclosed in `<div>`


```
<div class="thugin"> 
<h1 id="title">Thugify</h1>     
</div>
```
Unidented 
```
<div class="thugin"> 
  <h1 id="title">Thugify</h1>     
</div>
```
Indented

Isn't that easier to read?

**3. Let's create a place to input our text with the `<input>` self-enclosed tag**

`<input>` is a **self-enclosed tag** for creating an **input box.**

We'll be able to type in this box!

![](https---d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net-s_E2C9EC3A53C7D3F150F7715638F7F1B7BEFDBDD43B2CBAF8BECDEE9CE6CD10B0_1449368504615_Screen+Shot+2015-12-05+at+9.21.34+PM.png)

Give this input box an **id of "texter"**
`<input id="texter">`

We can give the box **"placeholder text"** as well~
* Placeholder text is the greyed out text (see the picture above)

Add a **`placeholder` attribute** (like `src` is an attribute);
* `placeholder="some text"` *right after the id*

`<input id="texter" placeholder="insert text">`

We've made the place holder simply say "insert text"

**4. Let's make a submit button with the `<button>` tag**

`<button>` is the tag for creating a button
* Just like the `<h1>` tag, this is another tag where we place text between the opening and closing tags to display on the webpage

Give this button the **text " thugin' "**

```<button> thugin' </button>```

Give this button an **id of "go"**

`<button id="go"> thugin'</button>`

We're going to tell the webpage that this is of **type-something**
  * In this case, it's a **button**!

To do this, we're also going to give this a **`type`** attribute

[Another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xdh0TeGNsTw) (**attribute**);

* type="button" *right before the id*
  * This is to ensure that the webpage understands we want a button
   * By specifying this, the HTML adds some build-in CSS styling

```
<div class="thugin"> 
  <h1 id="title"> Thugify</h1>  
  <button type="button" id="go"> thugin'</button>   
</div>
```

###*Look at that beautiful indenting. Is yours indented?*
![](http---i.imgur.com-qHEIc0k.gif)

**4. To create a space for our thugified content, let's create a `<p>` tag with an id of `output`**

`<p id="output"> </p>`

`<p>` stands for paragraph
* Just like the `<h1>` tag, this is another tag where we place text between the opening and closing tags to display on the webpage

Whatever text we type into the **input box** will have **", dawg"** added
* We will then add the text between the opening and closing `<p>` tags
  * We'll do this using **JavaScript**

Final Code (**do not copy and paste, you bumface**);
```
<body> 

<!-- Our main HTML -->
  <div class="thugin"> 
      <h1 id="title"> Thugify </h1>
      <input id="texter" placeholder="insert text">
      <button type="button" id="go"> thugin' </button>
      <p id="output"> </p>       
  </div>
  
<!-- Our JavaScript files, also referred to as simply "scripts" -->  
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="script.js"> </script>
  
</body>
```

##CSS
CSS (cascading style sheets) is the styling of our page
* This styling lives in the **style.css** file

We use selectors in CSS that select our HTML tags

We want **you** to style the page!
* If you feel uncomfortable, that's good! You'll only really grow by being put into uncomfortable situations and then figuring your way out

* Your peers are **here to help you** if you have any questions, **all you gotta do is ask**
  * **Google** is also amazing! it's what ***all programmers*** turn to, especially **professionals**!

If you feel completely lost, no worries! Go back to our older workshops and skim through those (linked at the top of this document).

###[We the best; you can put the hinges in the hands.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skY-FKgOIew)

##Javascript + jQuery, dawg
Remember that the variable names in the examples below can be **anything** you want, but we recommend sticking with ours in order to make the workshop easier to follow!

###Adding a Listener
To begin our JavaScript journey to [*Thug Land*](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9014119/19824102/cb1a4db2-9d3a-11e6-9bcd-deed6783092a.png) we'll need to add a listener to listen for a click on the **Thugify** button.
`document.getelementById('go')`

This line simply means: Find the element with the id **"go"** in the document.

Now we haven't done anything with this element yet, we want the button to trigger some code when someone presses it, so we'll add `.onclick = function() {}` to the end of the end of the line.

`.onclick` simply adds a rule to listen for a click on the button and runs whatever's behind it.
In this case, `= function() {}` happens to be assigned to it.

With that known, we can infer that `.onclick = function() {}` simply means: When a click is registered, run the following function.

To review, so far our code is
`document.getElementById('go').onclick = function() {}`
which simply says: Find the element 'go' and listen for a click on this element. If there is a registered click, run this function.

If you've followed along this far, awesome! You're doing great, we're almost done. If you're stuck, turn to a peer! We a team and we the best.

Now that we've gotten Javascript to listen for a click on the button, we need to tell it what to do when it gets a click.

###Creating a variable and assigning a value
Every line that we want to execute **needs** to be inside the curly brackets `function()`**`{}`**
Don't forget to indent it either! Remember, it'll make it easier to read.

So let's start with first finding what we need to **thugify.**

**Remember from the [Slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2l9FTYlGCocr8cqjLaHpp5tgv0hS-WI3US7PiMbRnc/edit#slide=id.gd76540ddf_0_22): When creating variables (var), whatever is on the right side, is always being assigned to the left side.**
* I.e. ```var div = content``` 
* the content on the right is going to be assigned to the variable `div` on the left

**The id `texter` is from the input box!**

We'll be grabbing the value from the input box, since the id `"texter"` is assigned to the box
* Whatever someone types into the input box will be retrieved with this line of JavaScript

To do that we need to use:
```var div = $('texter').val();```

WOAH HOLD UP DID YOU SEE THAT?????
LOOK AGAIN.

![](http---i.imgur.com-EQiLdKF.png)

You're probably wondering what the heck that `$` is doing here. Remember the libraries section in the [Slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2l9FTYlGCocr8cqjLaHpp5tgv0hS-WI3US7PiMbRnc/edit#slide=id.gd76540ddf_0_22)?

That's the **power** of **jQuery** at work. 

It took something we would normally use like
`document.getElementById('texter')`

And shortened it to:
`$('#texter')`

Of course `document.getElementById('')` would still work if you'd prefer that.

![](office.gif)

Note: It finds HTML elements exactly like a CSS selector would:
* ids would be: `$(#[id here])`
* Classes would be: `$(.[classname here])`
* Regular tag names would work too: `$('h1')`

Therefore:
`var div = $('#texter')`

Means the same thing as:
```var div = document.getElementById('#texter')```

Place `.val();` at the end of the line
* Takes the value of whatever's behind the `.`

So to clarify everything:
`var div = $('#texter').val();`
Means to take the **value of** the element **`texter`** and **store it into a new variable** called **`div`**

We're grabbing the value from the input box, since the id `"texter" is assigned to the box
* Whatever someone types into the input box the text will be retrieved with this line of JavaScript.

We're gonna use this ***string*** value to thugify later on.
* A string is a series of characters (text and numbers!)
  * This is also mentioned in the [Slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2l9FTYlGCocr8cqjLaHpp5tgv0hS-WI3US7PiMbRnc/edit#slide=id.gd76540ddf_0_22)

So, we've debunked that msyery!

![](mystery.gif)

Let's move on to performing the actual **thugifying** part of the string we got in the last part. 🏀

###Adding the `", dawg"` to the `add` Variable
We need to store the variable with the words from the input box and then **add** the word `", dawg"` to it.

`var add = div + ", dawg";`

This line takes the string we got in the last section (the variable div) from the input box, and adds `", dawg"` to the end of it, and then stores it into a new variable named `add`

Adding the two strings together is called `Concatenation.` Ya fancy, huh?

![](steveharvey.gif)


Alrighty, now that we're **thugin'** it's time to display our up text on the page — fo'shizzle.

###Displaying the Text
We're going to use `document.getElementById()` to find an element on the HTML page by it's id

`document.getElementById('output')`

This will take care of that job for us
* We're finding the element with the id `output`

**PS:** you can use jQuery's `$('')` for this as well since there's practically no downside.
* Try changing this line to use the jQuery syntax
  * Syntax means the grammar, spelling and set of rules of a language

Now then, we will stick `.innerHTML = add;` to the end of the line

`document.getElementById('output').innerHTML`

It's just like `$('#texter').val();` that we used before;
* Except this time we're setting the `innerHTML` value (the text inside the pairs of `<p>` tags) of an HTML element instead of getting a value from it.

Now we will assign the value of add to the `<p>` tag with the **id** of `output`

`document.getelementById('output').innerHTML = add;`

In plain English, this means:
* set the `innerHTML` of `"#output"` to the value of the **variable**, `add` (our th*ugified string variable → the variable that holds our text*)

Close your curly brackets of the function **(`}`)**, slap a semicolon **(`;`)** on the end of it and BAM you're done!



Final Code (**do not copy-pasta you bumface**):
```
document.getElementById('go').onclick = function() {
    var div = $('#texter').val();
    var add = div + ", dawg";
    document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = add; 
};
```

##You are now a JavaScript Legend.

Unless you copy-pasted then ehhhh. Maybe a half-legend or something.

Your mom thinks you're special, that's all that really matters*

##Thanks for completing our workshop <3
