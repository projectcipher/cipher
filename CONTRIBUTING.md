![Cipher's team](https://github.com/JevinSidhu/hackclub/blob/thugify-workshop/workshops/thugify/img/cipher-squad.jpg?raw=true alt="Dysfunctional Cipher")

Dysfunctional as fuck.

## Finding Something

Usually, as a contributor you know what you want to work on. Perhaps something along the lines of workshops or implementing guidelines.

However, if you do not know where to begin you can always search through the [open issues](https://github.com/projectcipher/cipher/issues) to find something suitable.

If you are absolutely lost, but still want to help, no worries! Go onto the next step. :)

## Talk To Us About It

If you want to help us build Cipher's content,
Message us either on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectcipher/), tweet at us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectcipher), or email us: team@projectcipher.io

## Create An Issue

If you think something should be changed, but don't want to implement the change, you can
[create an issue](https://github.com/projectcipher/cipher/issues/new) on the
repository. This will allow your idea to be shared and anyone will be able to claim and implement it. To sure to be as specific as possible so it is easy to do so.

## Make A Pull Request

After you have made your changes and pushed them onto your [GitHub
fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), you should create a
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). It is
best practice to have different Pull Requests for different groups of commits
which have different purposes.

For example, if you're fixing grammatical mistakes and proposing new sections to a guide, it is a good idea to create separate Pull Requests for this.

## Await Review

Before your code is merged into the repository, it must be reviewed by one
of the core contributors.

If all goes well, your changes should be merged quickly. If not, then we'll be sure to fix whatever the problem is asap!
